1. What are libraries good for?
-It can be used in linking. Collection of files can be packaged in the library so that you can link it to the library instead of linking it one at a time. It is an easy way to use an already written set of codes for your own program. It lessensthe time alotted to complete a program plus having a library can help with sharing of codes.
2. What are the two types of library and how are they different?
-Static libraries work just like the object files they are made of. When you link to a static library, its object files become part of the executable, just like individual object files do. The advantage of a static library is that once you link it into your executable, the executable can run without having the library file around. The disadvantage of static libraries is that they make the size of your executable larger.
-Shared object libraries remain separate from the executable, and the machine code they contain is loaded by the executable at runtime. The advantage of shared object libraries is that a single library can be used by several different executables. One more advantage of shared object libraries is that because they are loaded at runtime, you can create “plugins” that let you add code to an existing application without recompiling.
