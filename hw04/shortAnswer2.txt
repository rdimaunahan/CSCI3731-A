1. What is the problem with two-dimensional arrays in C/C++?
	-Passing two dimensional arrays in a function. Passing it in a function would make you specify the dimension of the array in compile time.
2. Describe two ways to work around C/C++'s problems with two dimensional arrays.
	-Method of flattening the array. It works by storing data in one dimensional array with rows laid end to end. Accessing the elements would need computation of offset into the array which gives flattening method a disadvantage.
	-Numerical Recipes Trick. It is the idea of using two array; one flat array and one array of pointers. Each pointer points to the start of the row in the flat array. Accessing the two dimensional array would be the same as accessing it in Java 
3. Is your computer big endian or little endian?
int main()  
{  
    unsigned int i = 1;  
    char *c = (char*)&i;  
    if (*c)  
        printf("Little endian");  
    else
        printf("Big endian");  
    return 0;  
}  

output : Little endian
